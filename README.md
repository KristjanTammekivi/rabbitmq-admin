# Rabbitmq Admin

Meant to interact with RabbitMQ management plugin's API.

Starting off with commands I need in Haredo test suite,
but will eventually include everything detailed in the
[documentation](https://rawcdn.githack.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/v3.9.13/deps/rabbitmq_management/priv/www/api/index.html).

## TODO

 * output tables in cli when requested
